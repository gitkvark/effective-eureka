The webserver needs a different configuration to work in minikube.
The nginx/Dockerfile.k8s file contains the necessary configurations.

In order to deploy the k8s cluster, we need to run the install_minikube
playbook.

Then we need to generate the docker images:

cd services/app_v1
docker build . -t app_v1

cd services/app_v2
docker build . -t app_v2

cd services/react-js
docker build . -t react-js

cd nginx
docker build . -t webserver -f Dockerfile.k8s

Then we need to export the docker archives from the local docker server.
These will be imported into minikube's image cache.

cd docker_images
docker save webserver -o webserver.tar
docker save app_v1 -o app_v1.tar
docker save app_v2 -o app_v2.tar
docker save react-js -o react-js.tar

Once these are in place, we can run the install_apps_kube playbook.

It works, but it (obviously) needs a lot of work to be production ready.
